                I need a paragraph to show off the first letter and first line css selectors. This web development course is really fun. The lectures are a bit shorted than I'd prefer, but I like the overall structure of the course. I've wanted to build my own website for quite a while, actually, but found CSS really confusing. After finally understanding how CSS works because of this class, I've concluded I'm an absolute goof and probably didn't see enough examples when trying to learn on my own. I think this should be enough of a paragraph for this assignment. Thanks!
