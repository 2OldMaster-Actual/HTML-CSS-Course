                <p>Taking this web development course has been an absolute blast.</p>
                <p>This website was supposed to have 3 pages. The homepage, a page to display my IT certificates, and a small list of projects I've worked on.</p>
                <p>I have had so much trouble trying to figure out how to get CSS to work the way I want it to that I wasn't able to actually create the pages I wanted. I got the color scheme down, though. I think the black and green look awesome!</p>
                <p>I need to play around a bit more, and probably go back over the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/html-tutorial/" id="courselink">Udemy</a> course another time or two.</p>
